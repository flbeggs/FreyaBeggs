		<h1>What is a Gamebook</h1>
		<p>A gamebook is a work of printed fiction that allows the reader to participate in the story by making <strong>choices</strong>. The
			<i>narrative branches</i> along various paths, typically through the use of numbered paragraphs or pages. Production of
			new gamebooks in the West <sub>decreased</sub> dramatically during the nineties as choice based stories have moved away
			from <sup>print based media</sup>.</p>
		<br />
		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p> There are three types of gamebooks. The first is the branching-plot novel, which require the reader to make choices
			but are otherwise like a regular novel. These Gamebooks are sometimes informally called choose your own
			adventure books or CYOA which is the name of the well known Choose Your Own Adventure series originally
			published by Bantam Books.<br /> The second type is the Solitaire adventure (an example of this is the Tunnels and Trolls
			series of gamebooks),<br /> which combines the branching-plot novel with the rules of a role-playing game, allowing the
			game to be played without a Gamemaster but may require the purchase of separate manuals.<br /> The third type is the
			Adventure gamebook (examples of these are the Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf series of gamebooks), which
			combines the branching-plot novel with a simple role-playing system unique to the book (or series).
		<br />
		<h3>Origins</h3>
		<p>Several influences contributed to the development of the gamebook format during the twentieth century. The
			possibility of having stories branching out into several different paths seems to have been first suggested by Jorge
			Luis Borges in his short story An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain (1941). This story features an author
			whose novel is a three-part story containing two branch points, and with nine possible endings. Another story by
			Borges, titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths">The Garden of Forking Paths</a> (1941), also describes a book with a maze-like narrative reminiscent of
			modern gamebooks. These stories, however, did not carry out the idea of branching-path narrative to full execution
